      ],
      correctAnswer: "B. The insurer would be in breach of the concentration limit and would need to submit a remedial plan.",

        "B. The reduction in total capital required because risks are not perfectly correlated.",
        "C. A flat fee applied to all insurers to account for unexpected losses.",
        "D. An extra cushion of capital an insurer must hold to cover adverse scenarios."
      ],
      correctAnswer: "B. The reduction in total capital required because risks are not perfectly correlated.",
